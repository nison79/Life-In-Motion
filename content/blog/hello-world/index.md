Late evening in the suburb of [Drama](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%94%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%BC%CE%B1_(%CF%80%CF%8C%CE%BB%CE%B7)) city two people are heading to the unknown, a chance to escape the
disclosure of the day

The city lights can be mesmerizing sometimes and can create mysterious patterns. Here the buildings are part of the cloud as the highlights of the photo are intense and in the foreground of the picture.

A crossroad is always a place to have second thoughts. Where are we going ?. Straight - left or right?. You decide the path to your life.

In long exposure the lights can be a stroke of an artist in the canvas. A bus is coming from the right corner of the picture with  high velocity and instantly paints a stroke of white color in the frame.

My precious daughter Elli is having a sunbath and she enjoys it. Slowly she understands the power of our planet star and I am very happy about it.

Stella in the kitchen with a bizzare look, looking the camera.

Elli and the shadow of me as I shooting the scene. The day was full of sunlight and it was great to experiment with shadows of forms.

<!-- This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
